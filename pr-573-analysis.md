# PR #573 Analysis - Deep URL Navigation & Cross-Platform Copy

## Initial WebFetch Results
The WebFetch tool is not returning the full PR page content with CodeRabbit comments. It's providing summaries instead of the raw content needed for analysis.

## Next Steps
1. Try alternative approaches to extract the full PR content
2. Manually examine each file in the PR to identify CodeRabbit comment locations
3. Use the GitHub API or direct file inspection to gather the complete review data

## Known CodeRabbit Comments (from previous attempts)
- 2 visible CodeRabbit comments identified:
  1. Race/selection bug in `loadFullDocument` function
  2. Document deletion handler using stale documents array

## Files Changed in PR
(Need to populate this with actual file list and changes)

## Analysis Status
- ❌ Full PR content not yet retrieved
- ❌ Complete CodeRabbit comment list not available
- ❌ Issue-by-issue analysis pending
