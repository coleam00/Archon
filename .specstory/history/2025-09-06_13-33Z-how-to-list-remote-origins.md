<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking how to list remote origins in git. This is a straightforward git command question. They want to see the remote repositories configured for their git repository.

To list your git remote origins, you can use one of these commands:

**Simple list of remote names:**
```bash
git remote
```

**Detailed list with URLs:**
```bash
git remote -v
```

The `-v` flag shows the full URLs for each remote (both fetch and push URLs if they differ).

If you're in your project directory (`/home/dave/Desktop/archon_fork`), you can run either command to see the configured remotes for this repository.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about git workflow when working with forks. From the terminal selection, I can see they have:


## Investigating Git Workflow  
- The user is inquiring about Git workflow practices when working with forked repositories.  
- Their setup includes "origin" linked to their fork, https://github.</details></think>

You're absolutely correct! When working with a fork, here's how it works:

**Your current setup:**
- `origin` = your fork (`https://github.com/davidbzyk/Archon.git`)
- `upstream` = the original repo (`https://github.com/coleam00/Archon.git`)

**What happens when you push:**

```bash
git push origin main  # or whatever branch
```

This will **only** update your fork on GitHub. It will **NOT** affect the upstream repository.

**To contribute to the upstream repo, you have a few options:**

1. **Pull Request (most common):**
   - Push your changes to your fork (`origin`)
   - Create a Pull Request from your fork to the upstream repo on GitHub

2. **If you have push access to upstream:**
   ```bash
   git push upstream main
   ```

**Typical fork workflow:**
```bash
# Fetch latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream changes into your local branch
git merge upstream/main

# Push the updated branch to your fork
git push origin main

# Then create a PR on GitHub from your fork to upstream
```

So yes, you're right - pushing to `origin` only updates your fork, not the maintainer's original repository. The maintainer (upstream) won't see your changes until you submit a pull request.

and how do ou sumit a pr

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking how to submit a pull request (PR). Since they're working with a fork (as we established from the previous conversation), I should explain the process of submitting a PR from a fork to the upstream repository.


## Outlining PR submission process  
- The user needs to submit a pull request (PR) from a forked repository to the upstream repository.</details></think>

Here's how to submit a pull request (PR) from your fork to the upstream repository:

## Step-by-Step Process:

### 1. **Make sure your fork is up to date**
```bash
# Fetch latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Switch to your main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main

# Push updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Create a feature branch**
```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch for your changes
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or if you already have changes on main, create branch from current state
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 3. **Make your changes and commit**
```bash
# Make your edits...
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
```

### 4. **Push your branch to your fork**
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. **Create the Pull Request on GitHub**

**Option A: From GitHub interface**
1. Go to your fork on GitHub: `https://github.com/davidbzyk/Archon`
2. Click the **"Compare & pull request"** button that appears after pushing
3. Or click **"Pull requests"** tab â†’ **"New pull request"**
4. Make sure:
   - **Base repository**: `coleam00/Archon` (upstream)
   - **Base branch**: `main` (or appropriate branch)
   - **Head repository**: `davidbzyk/Archon` (your fork)
   - **Compare branch**: `feature/your-feature-name` (your branch)

**Option B: From command line (if you have GitHub CLI)**
```bash
gh pr create --base upstream:main --head origin:feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. **Fill out the PR details**
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Description**: Explain what your changes do and why
- **Link any issues** if applicable
- **Add reviewers** if you know who should review

### 7. **After submission**
- The maintainer will review your PR
- They might request changes
- Once approved, they'll merge it

## Quick Command Summary:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Make changes...
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Then create PR on GitHub
```

The key is that you always push to your fork (`origin`) first, then create the PR to submit those changes to the upstream repository.
