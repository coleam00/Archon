# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Beta Development Guidelines

**Local-only deployment** - each user runs their own instance.

### Core Principles

- **No backwards compatibility; we follow a fix‑forward approach** — remove deprecated code immediately
- **Detailed errors over graceful failures** - we want to identify and fix issues fast
- **Break things to improve them** - beta is for rapid iteration
- **Continuous improvement** - embrace change and learn from mistakes
- **KISS** - keep it simple
- **DRY** when appropriate
- **YAGNI** — don't implement features that are not needed

### Error Handling

**Core Principle**: In beta, we need to intelligently decide when to fail hard and fast to quickly address issues, and when to allow processes to complete in critical services despite failures. Read below carefully and make intelligent decisions on a case-by-case basis.

#### When to Fail Fast and Loud (Let it Crash!)

These errors should stop execution and bubble up immediately: (except for crawling flows)

- **Service startup failures** - If credentials, database, or any service can't initialize, the system should crash with a clear error
- **Missing configuration** - Missing environment variables or invalid settings should stop the system
- **Database connection failures** - Don't hide connection issues, expose them
- **Authentication/authorization failures** - Security errors must be visible and halt the operation
- **Data corruption or validation errors** - Never silently accept bad data, Pydantic should raise
- **Critical dependencies unavailable** - If a required service is down, fail immediately
- **Invalid data that would corrupt state** - Never store zero embeddings, null foreign keys, or malformed JSON

#### When to Complete but Log Detailed Errors

These operations should continue but track and report failures clearly:

- **Batch processing** - When crawling websites or processing documents, complete what you can and report detailed failures for each item
- **Background tasks** - Embedding generation, async jobs should finish the queue but log failures
- **WebSocket events** - Don't crash on a single event failure, log it and continue serving other clients
- **Optional features** - If projects/tasks are disabled, log and skip rather than crash
- **External API calls** - Retry with exponential backoff, then fail with a clear message about what service failed and why

#### Critical Nuance: Never Accept Corrupted Data

When a process should continue despite failures, it must **skip the failed item entirely** rather than storing corrupted data

#### Error Message Guidelines

- Include context about what was being attempted when the error occurred
- Preserve full stack traces with `exc_info=True` in Python logging
- Use specific exception types, not generic Exception catching
- Include relevant IDs, URLs, or data that helps debug the issue
- Never return None/null to indicate failure - raise an exception with details
- For batch operations, always report both success count and detailed failure list

### Code Quality

- Remove dead code immediately rather than maintaining it - no backward compatibility or legacy functions
- Avoid backward compatibility mappings or legacy function wrappers
- Fix forward
- Focus on user experience and feature completeness
- When updating code, don't reference what is changing (avoid keywords like SIMPLIFIED, ENHANCED, LEGACY, CHANGED, REMOVED), instead focus on comments that document just the functionality of the code
- When commenting on code in the codebase, only comment on the functionality and reasoning behind the code. Refrain from speaking to Archon being in "beta" or referencing anything else that comes from these global rules.

## Development Commands

### Makefile (Recommended)

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile for streamlined development:

```bash
# Setup and validation
make install    # Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
make check      # Validate environment setup (Node.js, Docker, .env file)

# Development workflows (automatically runs make check first)
make dev        # Hybrid mode: backend in Docker, frontend local (recommended)
make dev-docker # Full Docker mode: all services in containers
make stop       # Stop all running services

# Testing and quality
make test       # Run all tests (frontend + backend)
make test-fe    # Frontend tests only
make test-be    # Backend tests only  
make lint       # Run all linters (frontend + backend)
make lint-fe    # Frontend linter only (ESLint + Biome)
make lint-be    # Backend linter only (Ruff auto-fix)

# Cleanup
make clean      # Remove all containers and volumes (with confirmation)
```

### Frontend (archon-ui-main/)

```bash
npm run dev              # Start development server on port 3737
npm run build            # Build for production
npm run lint             # Run ESLint on legacy code (excludes /features)
npm run lint:files path/to/file.tsx  # Lint specific files

# Biome for /src/features directory only
npm run biome            # Check features directory
npm run biome:fix        # Auto-fix issues
npm run biome:format     # Format code (120 char lines)
npm run biome:ai         # Machine-readable JSON output for AI
npm run biome:ai-fix     # Auto-fix with JSON output

# Testing
npm run test             # Run all tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui          # Run with Vitest UI interface
npm run test:coverage:stream  # Run once with streaming output
vitest run src/features/projects  # Test specific directory

# TypeScript
npx tsc --noEmit         # Check all TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep "src/features"  # Check features only
```

### Backend (python/)

#### Environment Setup & Validation

```bash
# Environment validation (called automatically by make dev/dev-docker)
node check-env.js        # Validates .env file exists and contains required variables
```

The `check-env.js` script validates:
- `.env` file exists (copy from `.env.example` if missing)
- Required variables: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` 
- URL format validation for `SUPABASE_URL`
- Service key length validation

#### Python Development (uv package manager)

```bash
# Dependency management with groups (see dependency groups section below)
uv sync --group all      # Install all dependencies
uv sync --group server   # Server container dependencies only
uv sync --group mcp      # MCP container dependencies only  
uv sync --group agents   # Agents container dependencies only
uv sync --group dev      # Development tools (ruff, mypy, pytest)

# Local development
uv run python -m src.server.main  # Run server locally on 8181
uv run pytest            # Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/test_api_essentials.py -v  # Run specific test
uv run ruff check        # Run linter
uv run ruff check --fix  # Auto-fix linting issues
uv run mypy src/         # Type check
```

#### Docker Operations

```bash
# Service profiles (see Docker profiles section below)
docker compose up --build -d       # Default: server, mcp, frontend
docker compose --profile backend up -d  # Backend only (for hybrid dev)
docker compose --profile agents up -d   # Include agents service
docker compose --profile full up -d     # All services

# Monitoring and maintenance
docker compose logs -f archon-server   # View server logs
docker compose logs -f archon-mcp      # View MCP server logs
docker compose restart archon-server   # Restart after code changes
docker compose down      # Stop all services
docker compose down -v   # Stop and remove volumes
```

### Quick Workflows

```bash
# Hybrid development (recommended) - backend in Docker, frontend local
make dev                 # Or manually: docker compose --profile backend up -d && cd archon-ui-main && npm run dev

# Full Docker mode
make dev-docker          # Or: docker compose up --build -d

# Run linters before committing
make lint                # Runs both frontend and backend linters
make lint-fe             # Frontend only (ESLint + Biome)
make lint-be             # Backend only (Ruff + MyPy)

# Testing
make test                # Run all tests
make test-fe             # Frontend tests only
make test-be             # Backend tests only
```

## Architecture Overview

@PRPs/ai_docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

#### TanStack Query Implementation

### Docker Compose Profiles

The project uses Docker profiles to control which services run:

```bash
# Profile combinations
docker compose up                        # Default: server, mcp, frontend only
docker compose --profile agents up      # Also includes agents service
docker compose --profile backend up     # Backend services only (server, mcp) - for hybrid dev
docker compose --profile frontend up    # Frontend only (for development)
docker compose --profile full up        # All services including agents

# Common development patterns
make dev                                 # Uses --profile backend (recommended hybrid mode)
make dev-docker                          # Uses --profile full (everything in containers)
```

**Profile Usage:**
- **Default** (no profile): Core services for typical use
- **backend**: For hybrid development (backend in Docker, frontend local)
- **agents**: Include PydanticAI agents service (optional, resource-intensive)
- **frontend**: Frontend container only (rarely used directly)
- **full**: Complete stack including all optional services

### Service Architecture

For architecture and file references:
@PRPs/ai_docs/DATA_FETCHING_ARCHITECTURE.md

For code patterns and examples:
@PRPs/ai_docs/QUERY_PATTERNS.md

#### Service Layer Pattern

See implementation examples:
- API routes: `python/src/server/api_routes/projects_api.py`
- Service layer: `python/src/server/services/project_service.py`
- Pattern: API Route → Service → Database

#### Error Handling Patterns

See implementation examples:
- Custom exceptions: `python/src/server/exceptions.py`
- Exception handlers: `python/src/server/main.py` (search for @app.exception_handler)
- Service error handling: `python/src/server/services/` (various services)

## ETag Implementation

@PRPs/ai_docs/ETAG_IMPLEMENTATION.md

## Database Setup & Migration

### Migration Files

The `/migration/` directory contains SQL scripts for database setup and updates:

```bash
migration/
├── complete_setup.sql              # Full database schema setup
├── RESET_DB.sql                    # Database reset script (destructive)
├── add_hybrid_search_tsvector.sql  # Adds tsvector for keyword search
└── add_source_url_display_name.sql # Adds display name field to sources
```

### Database Setup Process

1. **New Installation**: Execute `complete_setup.sql` for full schema
2. **Schema Updates**: Apply specific migration files in chronological order
3. **Development Reset**: Use `RESET_DB.sql` to completely reset (⚠️ destructive)

Migration files should be applied directly to your Supabase instance via the SQL editor or command line tools.

## Database Schema

Key tables in Supabase:

- `sources` - Crawled websites and uploaded documents
  - Stores metadata, crawl status, and configuration
- `documents` - Processed document chunks with embeddings
  - Text chunks with vector embeddings for semantic search
- `projects` - Project management (optional feature)
  - Contains features array, documents, and metadata
- `tasks` - Task tracking linked to projects
  - Status: todo, doing, review, done
  - Assignee: User, Archon, AI IDE Agent
- `code_examples` - Extracted code snippets
  - Language, summary, and relevance metadata

## API Naming Conventions

@PRPs/ai_docs/API_NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md

Use database values directly (no FE mapping; type‑safe end‑to‑end from BE upward):

## Python Dependency Groups

The backend uses `uv` with sophisticated dependency grouping in `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
# Install specific dependency groups
uv sync --group all      # All dependencies (for local development)
uv sync --group server   # Server container dependencies only
uv sync --group mcp      # MCP container dependencies only  
uv sync --group agents   # Agents container dependencies only
uv sync --group dev      # Development tools (ruff, mypy, pytest)

# Combine groups as needed
uv sync --group server --group dev  # Server deps + development tools
```

**Dependency Groups:**

- **dev**: Testing and linting tools (pytest, mypy, ruff, factory-boy)
- **server**: Main server dependencies (FastAPI, crawl4ai, supabase, openai, document processing)
- **server-reranking**: Optional ML dependencies (sentence-transformers, torch, transformers)  
- **mcp**: MCP protocol server dependencies (mcp, httpx, fastapi, supabase)
- **agents**: PydanticAI agents dependencies (pydantic-ai, fastapi, httpx)
- **all**: Combines all groups for comprehensive local development

**Container Usage:**
- Each Docker container installs only its required dependency group
- Reduces image size and attack surface
- Faster builds and deployments

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co  # Or http://host.docker.internal:8000 for local
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key-here      # Use legacy key format for cloud Supabase
```

Optional variables and full configuration:
See `python/.env.example` for complete list

### Repository Configuration

Repository information (owner, name) is centralized in `python/src/server/config/version.py`:
- `GITHUB_REPO_OWNER` - GitHub repository owner (default: "coleam00")
- `GITHUB_REPO_NAME` - GitHub repository name (default: "Archon")

This is the single source of truth for repository configuration. All services (version checking, bug reports, etc.) should import these constants rather than hardcoding repository URLs.

Environment variable override: `GITHUB_REPO="owner/repo"` can be set to override defaults.

## Common Development Tasks

### Add a new API endpoint

1. Create route handler in `python/src/server/api_routes/`
2. Add service logic in `python/src/server/services/`
3. Include router in `python/src/server/main.py`
4. Update frontend service in `archon-ui-main/src/features/[feature]/services/`

### Add a new UI component in features directory

**IMPORTANT**: Review UI design standards in `@PRPs/ai_docs/UI_STANDARDS.md` before creating UI components.

1. Use Radix UI primitives from `src/features/ui/primitives/`
2. Create component in relevant feature folder under `src/features/[feature]/components/`
3. Define types in `src/features/[feature]/types/`
4. Use TanStack Query hook from `src/features/[feature]/hooks/`
5. Apply Tron-inspired glassmorphism styling with Tailwind
6. Follow responsive design patterns (mobile-first with breakpoints)
7. Ensure no dynamic Tailwind class construction (see UI_STANDARDS.md Section 2)

### Add or modify MCP tools

1. MCP tools are in `python/src/mcp_server/features/[feature]/[feature]_tools.py`
2. Follow the pattern:
   - `find_[resource]` - Handles list, search, and get single item operations
   - `manage_[resource]` - Handles create, update, delete with an "action" parameter
3. Register tools in the feature's `__init__.py` file

### Debug MCP connection issues

1. Check MCP health: `curl http://localhost:8051/health`
2. View MCP logs: `docker compose logs archon-mcp`
3. Test tool execution via UI MCP page
4. Verify Supabase connection and credentials

### Fix TypeScript/Linting Issues

```bash
# TypeScript errors in features
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep "src/features"

# Biome auto-fix for features
npm run biome:fix

# ESLint for legacy code
npm run lint:files src/components/SomeComponent.tsx
```

## Code Quality Standards

### Frontend

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, no implicit any
- **Biome** for `/src/features/`: 120 char lines, double quotes, trailing commas
- **ESLint** for legacy code: Standard React rules
- **Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library

### Backend

- **Python 3.12** with 120 character line length
- **Ruff** for linting - checks for errors, warnings, unused imports
- **Mypy** for type checking - ensures type safety
- **Pytest** for testing with async support

## MCP Tools Available

When connected to Claude/Cursor/Windsurf, the following tools are available:

### Knowledge Base Tools

- `archon:rag_search_knowledge_base` - Search knowledge base for relevant content
- `archon:rag_search_code_examples` - Find code snippets in the knowledge base
- `archon:rag_get_available_sources` - List available knowledge sources
- `archon:rag_list_pages_for_source` - List all pages for a given source (browse documentation structure)
- `archon:rag_read_full_page` - Retrieve full page content by page_id or URL

### Project Management

- `archon:find_projects` - Find all projects, search, or get specific project (by project_id)
- `archon:manage_project` - Manage projects with actions: "create", "update", "delete"

### Task Management

- `archon:find_tasks` - Find tasks with search, filters, or get specific task (by task_id)
- `archon:manage_task` - Manage tasks with actions: "create", "update", "delete"

### Document Management

- `archon:find_documents` - Find documents, search, or get specific document (by document_id)

- `archon:manage_version` - Manage versions with actions: "create", "restore"

## Important Notes

- Projects feature is optional - toggle in Settings UI
- TanStack Query handles all data fetching; smart HTTP polling is used where appropriate (no WebSockets)
- Frontend uses Vite proxy for API calls in development
- Python backend uses `uv` for dependency management
- Docker Compose handles service orchestration
- TanStack Query for all data fetching - NO PROP DRILLING
- Vertical slice architecture in `/features` - features own their sub-features
