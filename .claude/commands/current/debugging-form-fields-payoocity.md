For this task I need you 
1. Look at how the  browser use functions on `/home/dave/Desktop/job_application_assitant/orchestrator_agent/sub_agents/application_submitter_agent/tools/browser_actions/multiagent_shared_browser_actions.py` lines 3095 to 4394 are created solely with playwright/browsueruse syntax.  Retain that information in context.  Use entirely made up data just to get this done quick.  But we need to see if we can use these functions and add onto them or make up entirely new ones to get this task accomplished.
