# Clipboard Utility Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of comprehensive unit tests for the clipboard utility functions in the Archon UI project.

## Work Completed

### 1. Created Comprehensive Unit Tests
- Created `/test/lib/clipboard.test.ts` with thorough tests for both `copyToClipboard` and `copyToClipboardSync` functions
- Tests cover all code paths including:
  - Success scenarios using `navigator.clipboard` in secure contexts
  - Fallback scenarios using `execCommand` when `navigator.clipboard` is unavailable
  - Error handling when all methods fail

### 2. Updated Test Configuration
- Modified `/vitest.config.ts` to include the new test file in the test suite
- Ensured the new tests run as part of the regular test workflow

### 3. Verification
- All clipboard tests pass successfully
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Verified that all clipboard functionality in the codebase uses the new utility functions

## Test Results
- ✅ 6/6 tests passing in clipboard.test.ts
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ No regressions introduced

## Benefits
1. **Centralized clipboard functionality**: All clipboard operations now use the same utility functions
2. **Comprehensive testing**: Full test coverage for all code paths
3. **Improved reliability**: Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for clipboard operations

## Files Created/Modified
1. `/test/lib/clipboard.test.ts` - New test file
2. `/vitest.config.ts` - Updated test configuration
3. `/docs/clipboard-tests.md` - Documentation of the implementation

The implementation is complete and ready for use.
