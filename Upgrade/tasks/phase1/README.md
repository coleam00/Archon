# Phase 1 â€” Execution Steps (Small, Isolated Tasks)

This directory breaks down the updated plan (see `../phase1-implementation-plan.v2.md`) into small, focused steps. Each step is self-contained, with context, acceptance criteria, tests, and rollback guidance. Execute steps in order, but each can be reasoned about and verified independently.

Order of execution
1) 01-backend-exclude-large-fields.md
2) 02-api-tasks-details-endpoint.md
3) 03-frontend-service-layer.md
4) 04-frontend-hooks.md
5) 05-task-edit-modal-lazy-loading.md
6) 06-server-side-validation.md
7) 07-db-migration.md
8) 08-tests-and-benchmarks.md
9) 09-deployment-and-monitoring.md

Notes
- Keep changes minimal and isolated per step.
- Prefer safe-by-default verification runs after each step (tests/linters).
- Follow Beta Guidelines: fail fast on invalid data; never store corrupted state; continue batch ops with detailed error reporting.

Next actions
- Start with Step 01. I can implement it now and run targeted tests.
