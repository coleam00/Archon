# Implementation Log: Steps 03-04 — Frontend Service Layer & Hooks

**Date:** 2025-01-09  
**Implemented:** Step 03 (Frontend Service Layer) + Step 04 (Frontend Hooks)  
**Time spent:** ~45 minutes

## Overview

Implemented Phase 1 task performance improvements focusing on a modular frontend architecture with lazy loading for task details to reduce payload size and improve perceived performance.

## What was done

### Step 03: Frontend Service Layer (Lightweight lists + on-demand details)

Goal: Service methods should return lightweight lists by default and fetch full task details on demand.

Implementation:
1. Extended `taskService.getTasksByProject()`:
   - New parameter `excludeLargeFields = true` (default)
   - Appends `?exclude_large_fields=true` query param to the backend request
   - Backwards compatible: `excludeLargeFields=false` returns full payload

2. Added `taskService.getTaskDetails()`:
   - New endpoint `/api/tasks/:id/details` for full task data
   - Lazy loading pattern for large fields (description, sources, code_examples)

Code changes (excerpt):
```ts
// archon-ui-main/src/features/projects/tasks/services/taskService.ts
async getTasksByProject(projectId: string, excludeLargeFields = true): Promise<Task[]> {
  const params = excludeLargeFields ? "?exclude_large_fields=true" : "";
  const tasks = await callAPIWithETag<Task[]>(`/api/projects/${projectId}/tasks${params}`);
  return tasks;
}

async getTaskDetails(taskId: string): Promise<Task> {
  return await callAPIWithETag<Task>(`/api/tasks/${taskId}/details`);
}
```

### Step 04: Frontend Hooks (useTaskDetails + lightweight useProjectTasks)

Goal: Provide TanStack Query hooks that encapsulate lazy loading and smart polling, avoiding prop drilling.

Implementation:
1. Extended Query Keys Factory:
```ts
export const taskKeys = {
  all: (projectId: string) => ["projects", projectId, "tasks"] as const,
  details: (taskId: string) => ["tasks", taskId, "details"] as const,
};
```

2. Added `useTaskDetails` hook:
   - Supports `enabled` option for conditional fetching
   - 30s `staleTime` for detail caching
   - Safe handling of undefined `taskId`

3. `useProjectTasks` continues to use lightweight lists by default:
   - The Step 03 default ensures `exclude_large_fields=true`
   - Smart Polling remains (5s base interval, pauses when inactive)

## Documentation consulted (via Context7 MCP)

Before implementation, I consulted relevant docs:
- TanStack Query: Query invalidation patterns, ETag-friendly flows
- Vitest: HTTP mocking, `vi.mock`/`vi.spyOn` patterns
- Zod: Error formatting & `safeParse`

These confirmed our approach (ETag caching + targeted invalidation) and provided best practices for tests.

## Tests

New/updated tests:
- `archon-ui-main/tests/tasks/service.taskService.test.ts` (Step 03)
- Extended: `archon-ui-main/src/features/projects/tasks/hooks/tests/useTaskQueries.test.ts` (Step 04)

Coverage highlights:
- Correct URL building for `exclude_large_fields`
- Response parsing for both service methods
- Error propagation via `ProjectServiceError`
- Hook behavior with `enabled`/disabled states
- Query key generation for lists and details

## Challenges and resolutions

1) Vitest not installed  
- Symptom: `sh: vitest: command not found`  
- Cause: local dev dependencies not installed  
- Resolution: Ran `npm ci` (with user approval)

2) ESBuild syntax error  
- Symptom: `ERROR: Unexpected "export"` in `useTaskQueries.ts`  
- Cause: Missing closing brace after `useProjectTasks` function  
- Resolution: Added the missing `}`

3) Mock issues in tests  
- Symptom: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'mockResolvedValue')`  
- Cause: `getTaskDetails` missing in the `vi.mock` service setup  
- Resolution: Extended the mock to include `getTaskDetails`

4) Test structure
- Symptom: Minor grouping/placement issues around new `useTaskDetails` tests  
- Resolution: Reorganized describe blocks and assertions for clarity

## What worked well

- Modular architecture: clear separation between service layer and hooks  
- ETag integration: reused existing client, aligned with polling & refetch  
- Backward compatibility: legacy calls keep working  
- Test coverage: changes validated with targeted tests  
- Strong typing: fully typed TS without `any`

## Final validation

Test run summary:
```
Test Files  5 passed (5)
Tests      39 passed (39)
Duration   ~1.8s
```
All tests passed; no regressions observed.

## Next steps

Proceed to Step 05 (Task Edit Modal Lazy Loading) — adopt the new hooks in UI components for on-demand detail loading.

## Architecture takeaways

1. ETag caching reduces bandwidth by 70–90% on repeated requests.  
2. Query Key Factory improves precision of invalidations and clarity of cache usage.  
3. Smart Polling (with visibility/focus awareness) keeps data fresh with minimal overhead.  
4. Lazy loading is an effective pattern for large task descriptions and related fields.

The implementation adheres to the Beta Development Guidelines: fail fast on invalid data, provide detailed errors, and never store corrupted data.
