# Step 08 – Tests & Benchmarks (Implementation Log)

Date: 2025-09-09
Owner: Augment Agent (GPT‑5)

## Scope
Implement and validate Step 08 from `Upgrade/tasks/phase1/steps/08-tests-and-benchmarks.md`:
- Add and run backend and frontend tests
- Introduce a lightweight payload benchmark for the tasks list
- Ensure “lightweight list + details endpoint” behavior stays correct and fast
- Keep 50-task list payload ≤ 25–30 KB

## Documentation consulted via Context7 MCP
- FastAPI: /tiangolo/fastapi
- Pytest: /pytest-dev/pytest
- TanStack Query: /tanstack/query
- Vitest: /vitest-dev/vitest
- React Testing Library: /testing-library/react-testing-library

Key patterns used:
- FastAPI TestClient; conditional ETag handling; clear HTTP semantics
- Pytest fixtures + service-mocking for isolation; validation tests
- TanStack Query testing with QueryClientProvider wrapper and disabled retries
- Vitest module mocks; React Testing Library for accessible, user-centric UI tests

## Changes made

### Backend
- Lightweight stats for tasks when excluding large fields:
  - File: `python/src/server/services/projects/task_service.py`
  - Behavior: If `exclude_large_fields=True`, omit bulky fields (description, sources, code_examples) but include `stats` with `sources_count` and `code_examples_count` when the raw record contains arrays. This preserves useful metadata without bloating payloads.
- Payload benchmark test aligned to actual API response shape:
  - File: `python/tests/test_tasks_payload_benchmark.py`
  - The endpoint `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/tasks` returns a JSON list (not an object). The benchmark now asserts a list of length 50 and enforces a ≤ 30 KB limit on both raw and stringified payload sizes.

### Frontend
- Existing tests for services, hooks, and TaskEditModal validated the Step 08 acceptance criteria:
  - URL building with `exclude_large_fields` param
  - Lazy details pattern via details endpoint
  - Hooks rollback/safety on errors; enabled-state respected
  - Modal state safety, loading, and error handling

## Test execution & results

### Backend (safe verification)
- Command: `uv run pytest -q -v`
- Result: 441 passed, 0 failed, 122 warnings

Relevant coverage of Step 08:
- Token optimization + lightweight list behavior: green
- Details endpoint 200/404 and error logging: green
- 50k description limit (create/update): green
- New payload benchmark for 50 tasks ≤ 30 KB: green

### Frontend (safe verification)
- Command: `npm run test:coverage`
- Result: 6 test files, 42 tests – all passed
- Coverage report generated (v8). Console shows expected warnings for dialog a11y descriptions during modal tests, but no test failures.

## What worked well
- The existing services and hooks architecture made it straightforward to validate “lightweight lists + details endpoint” patterns.
- ETag handling and payload trimming were already designed with optimization in mind, requiring only minimal adjustments.
- The test infrastructure (Pytest + Vitest + RTL) is solid; adding a payload benchmark and aligning expectations was quick.

## What didn’t work initially and why
1) Payload benchmark expected the wrong response shape
- Symptom: The new backend benchmark test assumed an object with `{ tasks: [...] }`, but `/api/projects/{id}/tasks` returns a bare array `[...]`.
- Cause: Mismatch between test expectation and the actual API contract.
- Resolution: Updated the benchmark test to assert `list` type and length; measured size accordingly.

2) Missing lightweight stats in TaskService for exclude mode
- Symptom: In exclude mode (`exclude_large_fields=True`), tests verifying token optimization expected a `stats` object with counts.
- Cause: The service previously omitted bulky fields but didn’t provide counts.
- Resolution: Enhanced `TaskService.list_tasks` to add `stats.sources_count` and `stats.code_examples_count` when source arrays exist in records, while still omitting the large arrays themselves.

3) Frontend warnings in modal tests
- Symptom: React Testing Library logs warnings about Dialog content missing ARIA description.
- Cause: Expected by test setup focusing on async states; no functional failure.
- Resolution: Left as-is for now; warnings do not impact test outcomes or accessibility of the tested flows. Can be cleaned up later by adding a descriptive element.

## How issues were solved (summary)
- Adjusted benchmark test to the endpoint’s exact return type (list) and re-ran tests.
- Augmented TaskService logic to include lightweight `stats` when excluding large fields, satisfying token optimization tests.
- Re-ran full backend and frontend suites to confirm all green.

## Evidence for payload goal (50 tasks ≤ 25–30 KB)
- Backend benchmark test enforces ≤ 30 KB on both raw `resp.content` and `json.dumps(body)` for a synthetic 50-task lightweight list.
- The test passed in CI-like local run (`uv run pytest -q -v`).

## Commands used
- Backend: `uv run ruff check && uv run mypy src/ && uv run pytest -v`
- Frontend: `npm run test:coverage`

## File touches (key entries)
- Updated: `python/src/server/services/projects/task_service.py`
- Updated: `python/tests/test_tasks_payload_benchmark.py`

## Recommendations / Next steps (optional)
- If we want to tighten the payload target further (e.g., ≤ 25 KB), we can:
  - Further trim fields in the lightweight list
  - Ensure no accidental inclusion of optional metadata or timestamps not required by the UI list
- Add an a11y description element to the dialog content in tests to remove warnings (non-blocking)
- Consider adding a tiny end-to-end integration around the edit flow to assert timing and ETag headers (optional, as current tests already cover behavior)
