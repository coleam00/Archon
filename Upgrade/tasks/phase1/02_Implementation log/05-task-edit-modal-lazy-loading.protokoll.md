# Step 05 — UI: TaskEditModal lazy-loads details (Implementation Log)

## Summary
- Implemented lazy loading of full task details in `TaskEditModal` to improve perceived performance and avoid blocking the modal open animation with heavy fields.
- Added explicit loading and error states with a retry mechanism and guarded save to prevent partial/corrupted writes when details failed to load.
- Wrote focused tests to verify loading placeholder, error+retry behavior, and the create-new flow.
- Verified changes via targeted and full test runs. Addressed a unit test environment issue related to icon components.

## Why
- The modal was opening with the full task payload, which can include large fields (e.g., long descriptions or future heavy metadata), causing sluggish UX. Lazy-loading details only when the modal is open and an existing task is being edited improves perceived performance without changing the create-new flow.

## Scope and Files
- Primary file: `archon-ui-main/src/features/projects/tasks/components/TaskEditModal.tsx`
- Tests: `archon-ui-main/tests/tasks/components.TaskEditModal.test.tsx`

## What I did
1) Integrated the existing `useTaskDetails` hook into `TaskEditModal` with conditional `enabled`:
   - `useTaskDetails(editingTask?.id, { enabled: isModalOpen && !!editingTask?.id })`
   - Mirrors the acceptance criteria and leverages TanStack Query's `enabled` pattern.

2) Hydrated local form state when details arrive:
   - When editing an existing task and `taskDetails` are fetched, we update `localTask` to those details to keep the form in sync.

3) Added clear loading and error UI:
   - Loading: shows a placeholder ("Loading task details…") while details are being fetched.
   - Error: shows an error message and a "Retry" button which triggers `refetch()`.

4) Guarded the save action against missing/failed details:
   - The "Update Task" button is disabled if details are still loading, failed, or missing for an existing task.
   - `handleSave` also short-circuits in that scenario to prevent partial writes.

5) Kept create-new flow unchanged:
   - New tasks bypass `useTaskDetails` and render immediate empty defaults.

## How I implemented it
- Followed the Step 05 acceptance criteria word-for-word:
  - Invoked `useTaskDetails` only when the modal is open and `editingTask?.id` is available.
  - Introduced minimal state and UI changes to avoid broad refactors.
  - Ensured the component remains controlled by Radix Dialog `open` and `onOpenChange` props.

- Concrete changes in `TaskEditModal.tsx`:
  - Added the query call and destructured `data`, `isLoading`, `isError`, `refetch`.
  - Rendered conditional UI blocks for loading and error.
  - Wrapped the form in a guard so it only renders when not loading/errored (or in create-new mode).
  - Extended the "Save" button `disabled` predicate and added a function-level guard.

## Documentation consulted (Context7 MCP)
- TanStack Query
  - `useQuery` with `enabled`, `refetch`, and status flags (`isLoading`, `isError`).
  - Reason: Implement lazy fetch and retry UX correctly.
- Radix UI Dialog
  - Controlled `open` and `onOpenChange` behavior for proper modal lifecycle.
  - Reason: Ensure we don't regress modal control while adding asynchronous fetch states.

## Tests
- Added `archon-ui-main/tests/tasks/components.TaskEditModal.test.tsx` covering:
  - Loading placeholder visible; update/save disabled.
  - Error state with Retry calling `refetch`; update/save disabled.
  - Create-new flow not blocked by details fetching.
- Test utilities and mocks:
  - Mocked `useTaskEditor` to avoid network/dependency noise.
  - Mocked `useTaskDetails` per test case to simulate loading/error/success states.
  - Mocked `lucide-react` icons used by ComboBox primitives to run in JSDOM (avoids missing export errors during render).

## What worked
- The `enabled` pattern in TanStack Query behaved as expected; details were only fetched when the modal was open and a valid `taskId` existed.
- Conditional UI ensured the form UI is only shown when safe to edit existing tasks.
- Guarding both the button and the handler prevented accidental partial writes.
- Tests validated both the UX and the safeguards.

## What didn’t work initially & how I resolved it
- Issue: Running only the new test initially failed due to a `lucide-react` mock problem (`ChevronsUpDown` missing) triggered via UI primitives used by `FeatureSelect`.
  - Why: The primitives rely on specific icon exports; JSDOM+Vitest needs explicit mocks when rendering those components.
  - Fix: Added a partial mock for `lucide-react` in the test to provide minimal implementations for `ChevronsUpDown` and `Check`.

- Warning: Radix `DialogContent` reported missing `Description`/`aria-describedby` in tests.
  - Why: Our dialog content doesn’t currently render a `Dialog.Description` (non-functional warning).
  - Current state: Left as-is because it doesn’t affect behavior or acceptance criteria; can be addressed in a follow-up.

## Verification
- Full suite (frontend): `npm run test`
  - Result: All existing tests passed (39/39) per project’s test layout.
- Focused run: `npx vitest run tests/tasks/components.TaskEditModal.test.tsx`
  - Result: 3/3 passed (with the Radix a11y warnings mentioned above).

## Follow-ups (Optional)
- Add `Dialog.Description` or `aria-describedby={undefined}` to remove Radix accessibility warning in tests.
- Consider minor UX polish for the loading/error placeholders (e.g., spinner component consistency) to match design language.

## Notes on Beta Guidelines
- Fail-fast behavior preserved for invalid/corrupted states by guarding the save action.
- No storing of incomplete data: the update path is blocked until a complete, valid details payload is available for existing tasks.
