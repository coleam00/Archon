# Step 09 – Deployment and Monitoring (Implementation Log)

Date: 2025-09-09
Owner: Augment Agent (GPT‑5)
Scope: Implement deployment-and-monitoring requirements from Phase 1, Step 09; consult Context7 docs; enhance observability without risky changes.

## Summary

Implemented low-risk, modular observability updates and prepared a safe rollout runbook:
- Backend: Extended FastAPI logging middleware to include request/response sizes (via Content-Length headers) and ensured error logs include full stack traces.
- Frontend: Added a lightweight Performance API hook to surface Navigation Timing and Server-Timing metrics in the browser console.
- Verification: Ran frontend and backend test suites; both green.
- Runbook: Added practical pre-deploy checks, DB migration notes for CONCURRENTLY, Docker Compose deploy steps, and acceptance/rollback guidance.

## Context7 documentation consulted
- FastAPI/Starlette middleware and logging patterns
- Uvicorn logging and access logs
- PostgreSQL CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY (non-transactional requirements)
- Supabase migrations structure and CLI basics
- Vite build and deployment conventions
- MDN Web Performance APIs (PerformanceObserver, Navigation Timing, Server-Timing)

## Changes in the codebase

- Backend (FastAPI)
  - File: `python/src/server/middleware/logging_middleware.py`
  - Add request size logging: `req_bytes` from `Content-Length` header
  - Add response size logging: `resp_bytes` from `Content-Length` header
  - Ensure errors log stacktraces using `exc_info=True`
  - Rationale: header-based sizes avoid reading bodies (no perf/behavior regressions) and provide consistent metrics for acceptance criteria.

- Frontend (React)
  - File (new): `archon-ui-main/src/hooks/usePerformanceMetrics.ts`
  - Captures Navigation Timing on initial load; observes Navigation/Resource entries for `serverTiming` if present
  - File (integration): `archon-ui-main/src/App.tsx` (import + call inside `AppContent`)
  - Rationale: zero-risk, console-only metrics for beta; can later wire to an internal endpoint if needed.

## What worked

1) Test suites
- Frontend: `npm run test` – 6 files, 42 tests passed; JSON report generated. Duration ~1.7s.
- Backend: `uv run pytest tests/test_api_essentials.py -v` – 10 tests passed. Duration ~1.9s.

2) Observability
- Backend logs now show lines like `HTTP Request ... req_bytes=...` and `HTTP Response ... resp_bytes=... duration_ms=...`.
- Errors include full stacktraces where thrown.
- Frontend console shows `[perf] NavigationTiming` and (if provided by server) `[perf] ServerTiming` entries.

3) Safety
- No behavioral changes to business logic; only instrumentation and a passive client hook.
- DB migration guidance adheres to `CONCURRENTLY` rules (outside transactions).

## What didn’t work and why

1) `npm run test -w=1` (workspace flag)
- Error: "No workspaces found". This repo’s UI package is not configured as a multi-workspace root for that flag.
- Resolution: Run plain `npm run test` from `archon-ui-main/`.

2) A11y warnings in UI tests (`DialogContent` description)
- Vitest emitted Radix a11y warnings (missing Description/aria-describedby). Tests still passed.
- Resolution: Non-blocking for Step 09; left as-is. We can address a11y improvements separately.

3) Persisting client metrics to backend
- Not implemented intentionally to minimize scope and avoid introducing new endpoints during deployment hardening.
- Resolution: Kept metrics console-only per beta guidelines. Optional improvement planned (internal metrics endpoint) if needed later.

## How issues were resolved
- Used the simplest working commands (no workspace flags) to run tests successfully.
- Chose header-based size logging to avoid reading request/response bodies (no perf overhead, reliable values when headers present).
- Ensured `exc_info=True` for error logs to provide complete stacktraces for faster debugging.
- Implemented a passive, isolated Performance API hook that requires no server changes and cannot impact production stability.

## Verification steps executed

- Frontend
  - `npm run test` in `archon-ui-main/` → 42/42 tests passed; duration ~1.7s.
- Backend
  - `uv run pytest tests/test_api_essentials.py -v` in `python/` → 10/10 tests passed; duration ~1.9s.

## Rollout runbook (Step 09)

1) Pre-deploy
- Ensure tests are green (commands above).
- Baseline metrics:
  - Backend: tail logs and record `duration_ms`, `resp_bytes` for key endpoints.
  - Frontend: open app and note `[perf] NavigationTiming` values (domInteractive, domComplete).

2) Database migration (non-blocking)
- File: `migration/07_add_archon_tasks_indexes.sql`
- Ensure `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` statements run outside transactions.
- Apply via Supabase SQL editor or CLI (no BEGIN/COMMIT wrapping).

3) Deploy backend
- `docker compose build archon-server`
- `docker compose up -d archon-server`
- Verify logs:
  - `docker compose logs -f --tail=100 archon-server`
  - Expect `HTTP Request/Response` lines with `req_bytes`, `resp_bytes`, `duration_ms`.

4) Deploy frontend
- `cd archon-ui-main && npm run build`
- If using Docker: `docker compose build archon-ui && docker compose up -d archon-ui`
- In browser console: verify `[perf] NavigationTiming`, and `[perf] ServerTiming` if server headers present.

5) Acceptance
- Request sizes and error stacktraces present in backend logs.
- Latency observable via `duration_ms`.
- Client performance visible via console.

6) Rollback
- If regressions occur: redeploy previous image tags for `archon-server`/`archon-ui` via Docker Compose.

## Recommended next steps (optional)
- Add a small internal endpoint to collect aggregated client performance metrics for dashboards.
- Targeted slow-query logging (EXPLAIN) around any routes showing latency increases.
- Address Radix a11y warnings in tests.

## Files touched
- `python/src/server/middleware/logging_middleware.py`
- `archon-ui-main/src/hooks/usePerformanceMetrics.ts` (new)
- `archon-ui-main/src/App.tsx`
- No schema or service logic changed.
