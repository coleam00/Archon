# Pull Request - Deep URL Linking Final Fixes

## Summary
This PR addresses the final two issues in the deep URL linking feature for task management:
1. **Task highlighting not working** - Tasks accessed via deep URL (`/task/{id}`) were not being highlighted in Board or Table views
2. **View persistence broken** - Deep URL navigation always switched to Board view regardless of user's current view preference

## Changes Made
- **Added selectedTaskId prop chain**: Updated TasksTab → TaskTableView/TaskBoardView → DraggableTaskRow/DraggableTaskCard component hierarchy to pass selectedTaskId through all levels
- **Implemented task highlighting in Table view**: Added conditional CSS classes to DraggableTaskRow for selected task highlighting with blue gradient background and ring
- **Implemented task highlighting in Board view**: Added conditional CSS classes to DraggableTaskCard for selected task highlighting with blue-purple gradient background and shadow
- **Added view persistence**: Implemented localStorage-based view mode persistence to maintain user's preferred view (Table/Board) when navigating via deep URLs
- **Fixed prop interfaces**: Updated TypeScript interfaces for all affected components to include selectedTaskId parameter

## Type of Change
- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)

- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Performance improvement
- [ ] Code refactoring

## Affected Services
- [x] Frontend (React UI)
- [ ] Server (FastAPI backend)
- [ ] MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)
- [ ] Agents (PydanticAI service)
- [ ] Database (migrations/schema)
- [ ] Docker/Infrastructure
- [ ] Documentation site

## Testing
- [ ] All existing tests pass ⚠️ **PENDING VERIFICATION**
- [ ] Added new tests for new functionality
- [ ] Manually tested affected user flows ⚠️ **PENDING USER TESTING**
- [ ] Docker builds succeed for all services

### Test Evidence
**⚠️ TESTING STATUS: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE, USER VERIFICATION PENDING**

**Manual Testing Required:**
1. **Task Highlighting Test**: 
   - Navigate to `/projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}` via direct URL
   - Verify task is highlighted in both Board and Table views
   - Confirm highlighting visual consistency (blue-purple gradient background, proper contrast)

2. **View Persistence Test**:
   - Set view to Table mode, navigate away, return via deep URL → Should preserve Table view
   - Set view to Board mode, navigate away, return via deep URL → Should preserve Board view
   - Test with browser refresh and new tab navigation

3. **Component Integration Test**:
   - Verify selectedTaskId prop is correctly passed through all component levels:
     - TasksTab receives selectedTaskId from ProjectPage
     - TaskTableView and TaskBoardView receive selectedTaskId from TasksTab
     - DraggableTaskRow and DraggableTaskCard receive and use selectedTaskId for highlighting

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **TasksTab.tsx** (`/archon-ui-main/src/components/project-tasks/TasksTab.tsx`)
   - Added localStorage-based view mode initialization: `useState(() => localStorage.getItem('tasksViewMode'))`
   - Added useEffect to persist view mode changes to localStorage
   - Updated TaskTableView and TaskBoardView prop passing to include selectedTaskId

2. **TaskTableView.tsx** (`/archon-ui-main/src/components/project-tasks/TaskTableView.tsx`)
   - Updated TaskTableViewProps interface to include `selectedTaskId?: string`
   - Updated DraggableTaskRowProps interface to include selectedTaskId
   - Modified function signature to accept selectedTaskId parameter
   - Updated DraggableTaskRow prop passing to include selectedTaskId

3. **TaskBoardView.tsx** (`/archon-ui-main/src/components/project-tasks/TaskBoardView.tsx`)
   - Updated TaskBoardViewProps interface to include `selectedTaskId?: string`
   - Updated ColumnDropZoneProps interface to include selectedTaskId
   - Modified function signature and all ColumnDropZone calls to pass selectedTaskId
   - Updated DraggableTaskCard prop passing to include selectedTaskId

4. **DraggableTaskCard.tsx** (`/archon-ui-main/src/components/project-tasks/DraggableTaskCard.tsx`)
   - Updated DraggableTaskCardProps interface to include `selectedTaskId?: string`
   - Modified function signature to accept selectedTaskId parameter
   - Added selectedHighlight CSS class logic for selected tasks
   - Applied highlighting to both front and back sides of flip cards

### Styling Implementation
```typescript
// Task highlighting classes
const selectedHighlight = selectedTaskId === task.id
  ? 'bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-100/90 to-purple-100/90 dark:from-blue-900/50 dark:to-purple-900/50 border-blue-400/70 dark:border-blue-500/60 shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(59,130,246,0.3)]'
  : '';
```

### View Persistence Implementation  
```typescript
// Initialize from localStorage with fallback
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'table' | 'board'>(() => {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem('tasksViewMode');
  return (saved === 'table' || saved === 'board') ? saved : 'board';
});

// Persist changes to localStorage
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('tasksViewMode', viewMode);
}, [viewMode]);
```

## Additional Notes
- The highlighting implementation maintains visual consistency with existing project and document highlighting patterns
- View persistence uses localStorage for immediate persistence without server dependency
- All changes are non-breaking and maintain existing component APIs
- The prop chain pattern follows React best practices for data flow
- Both light and dark mode theming is supported for the highlighting styles
