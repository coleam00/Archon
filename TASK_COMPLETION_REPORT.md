# Task Completion Report: Implement Search for Papers

## Task ID
6729c395-7aff-4d6c-ab1a-dd70cc16ce14

## Project
SciHub To PDF (dddf39be-34f2-4ba0-a4e1-7b4443e71ef7)

## Status
COMPLETED

## Description
Create a feature to allow users to search keywords on PubMed and tag all the papers they would like to download. Once tagged, extract their DOI address and retrieve all of them from Sci-Hub.

## Implementation Summary

### Features Implemented
1. ✅ PubMed paper search functionality
2. ✅ Paper tagging system
3. ✅ DOI extraction from paper metadata
4. ✅ Sci-Hub paper downloading
5. ✅ Background download processing

### Files Created
- `/projects/Archon/python/src/server/services/papers/` (directory with all service files)
- `/projects/Archon/python/src/server/api_routes/papers_api.py`
- `/projects/Archon/python/tests/test_papers_api.py`
- `/projects/Archon/PAPER_SEARCH_FEATURE.md` (this document)

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/papers/search` - Search papers on PubMed
- `POST /api/papers/tag` - Tag a paper for download
- `DELETE /api/papers/tag` - Untag a paper
- `GET /api/papers/tagged` - Get list of tagged papers
- `POST /api/papers/download` - Download tagged papers

## Technical Approach
The implementation follows the existing Archon microservices architecture:
1. Created modular services for PubMed and Sci-Hub functionality
2. Integrated with the existing FastAPI application
3. Used asynchronous programming for better performance
4. Added proper error handling and logging
5. Created basic tests following existing patterns

## Dependencies
All required dependencies were already available in the project:
- `httpx` for HTTP requests
- `beautifulsoup4` for HTML parsing
- Standard library modules for XML parsing

## Testing
Basic API endpoint tests were created to verify functionality.

## Documentation
Comprehensive documentation was created in:
- `/projects/Archon/python/src/server/services/papers/README.md`
- `/projects/Archon/PAPER_SEARCH_FEATURE.md` (this document)
