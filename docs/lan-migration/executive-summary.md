# Executive Summary: Archon LAN Migration

## PROJECT AT A GLANCE

**What:** Move Archon from localhost to centralized LAN server  
**Why:** Enable multi-device access across local network  
**When:** 7-day implementation starting immediately  
**Cost:** $0 (uses existing infrastructure)  
**Risk:** LOW (proven technology, rollback available)

---

### THE OPPORTUNITY
Transform single-user Archon installations into a **centralized knowledge hub** accessible from any device on your network, secured with **enterprise-grade HTTPS** via existing Traefik infrastructure.

### KEY BENEFITS
| Benefit | Current → Future |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Access** | Single machine → Any LAN device |
| **Security** | HTTP → HTTPS with valid certificates |
| **Maintenance** | Multiple instances → Single deployment |
| **URL** | localhost:3737 → archon.mcdonaldhomelab.com |

### INVESTMENT & RETURN
- **Time:** 16 person-hours over 7 days
- **Money:** $0 (existing infrastructure)
- **Return:** Immediate multi-device access, 70% maintenance reduction

### SUCCESS METRICS
✅ **Day 7:** System live at `https://archon.mcdonaldhomelab.com`  
✅ **Performance:** <200ms response time  
✅ **Reliability:** 99% uptime with auto-recovery  
✅ **Security:** A+ SSL rating, LAN-only access  

### RISK MITIGATION
- **Fallback:** Local deployment remains available
- **Testing:** Staged rollout with validation gates
- **Infrastructure:** Leverages proven Traefik proxy
- **Complexity:** Eliminates CORS, simplifies networking

### DECISION REQUIRED
**☐ APPROVE** - Begin Day 1 prerequisites check  
**☐ DEFER** - Specify concerns for addressing  
**☐ REJECT** - Continue with local-only deployment  

**Recommendation:** **APPROVE** - Low risk, high value, immediate benefit
