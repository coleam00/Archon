# Deep URL Linking

Archon supports deep URL linking that allows you to link directly to specific projects, documents, and tasks within the application.

## Overview

With deep URL linking, you can:

- Share direct links to specific projects
- Navigate directly to project documents
- Link to specific tasks within projects
- Maintain navigation state across browser refreshes

## URL Structure

The deep URL linking follows a hierarchical structure:

### Project URLs

- `/projects` - Projects page (shows all projects)
- `/projects/{projectId}` - Specific project (defaults to tasks tab)
- `/projects/{projectId}/docs` - Project documents tab
- `/projects/{projectId}/tasks` - Project tasks tab

### Document URLs

- `/projects/{projectId}/docs/{documentId}` - Specific document within a project

### Task URLs

- `/projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}` - Specific task within a project

## Examples

Here are some example URLs you might use:

```
# View all projects
https://your-archon-instance.com/projects

# View specific project (defaults to tasks)
https://your-archon-instance.com/projects/452536cf-1fd2-45dc-82cb-064c79f487f8

# View project's documents tab
https://your-archon-instance.com/projects/452536cf-1fd2-45dc-82cb-064c79f487f8/docs

# View specific document
https://your-archon-instance.com/projects/452536cf-1fd2-45dc-82cb-064c79f487f8/docs/abc123-def456

# View project's tasks tab
https://your-archon-instance.com/projects/452536cf-1fd2-45dc-82cb-064c79f487f8/tasks

# View specific task
https://your-archon-instance.com/projects/452536cf-1fd2-45dc-82cb-064c79f487f8/tasks/task789-xyz012
```

## How It Works

### Frontend Routing

The application uses React Router v6 with the following route definitions:

- `Route path="/projects" element={<ProjectPage />}`
- `Route path="/projects/:projectId" element={<ProjectPage />}`
- `Route path="/projects/:projectId/docs" element={<ProjectPage />}`
- `Route path="/projects/:projectId/docs/:documentId" element={<ProjectPage />}`
- `Route path="/projects/:projectId/tasks" element={<ProjectPage />}`
- `Route path="/projects/:projectId/tasks/:taskId" element={<ProjectPage />}`

### URL Parameter Handling

The `ProjectPage` component:

1. Extracts URL parameters using `useParams()` from React Router
2. Automatically selects the appropriate project based on the `projectId` parameter
3. Switches to the correct tab based on the URL path (`/docs` or `/tasks`)
4. Pre-selects documents or tasks when their IDs are in the URL

### Navigation Updates

When users interact with the interface:

- Selecting a project updates the URL to `/projects/{projectId}/tasks`
- Switching tabs updates the URL path appropriately
- Selecting documents/tasks appends their IDs to the URL
- All navigation preserves the current state and is shareable

## Browser Navigation

The deep URL linking system fully supports:

- **Forward/Back buttons**: Navigate through your project history
- **Bookmarks**: Save direct links to specific projects, documents, or tasks
- **Page refresh**: Maintains your current location and selections
- **Copy/Paste URLs**: Share exact locations with team members

## Implementation Details

### Component Updates

The following components were enhanced for deep URL linking:

#### ProjectPage
- Added URL parameter extraction with `useParams()`
- Added navigation handling with `useNavigate()`
- Enhanced project selection logic to handle URL-based selection
- Added tab switching based on URL paths

#### DocsTab
- Added `selectedDocumentId` prop for URL-based document selection
- Added `onDocumentSelect` callback for URL updates
- Implemented automatic document selection from URL parameters

#### TasksTab
- Added `selectedTaskId` prop for URL-based task selection
- Added `onTaskSelect` callback for URL updates
- Enhanced to support direct task linking (implementation varies by view mode)

### URL State Management

The system maintains URL state through:

1. **Route Parameters**: Project, document, and task IDs
2. **Path-based Tabs**: `/docs` and `/tasks` determine active tab
3. **Navigation Replacement**: Uses `replace: true` to avoid cluttering browser history during normal navigation

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Bookmarking**: Save direct links to frequently accessed projects
- **Sharing**: Send colleagues direct links to specific documents or tasks
- **Navigation**: Use browser back/forward buttons intuitively
- **Context Preservation**: Page refreshes don't lose your place

### For Teams
- **Collaboration**: Share exact locations in project discussions
- **Documentation**: Include direct links in external documentation
- **Issue Tracking**: Reference specific tasks or documents in bug reports
- **Onboarding**: Provide new team members with direct links to relevant resources

## Technical Considerations

### Projects Feature Toggle

Deep URL linking respects the projects feature toggle:

- When projects are disabled, `/projects/*` routes redirect to the home page
- This ensures the feature doesn't break when projects are turned off

### Error Handling

The system gracefully handles:

- **Invalid Project IDs**: Falls back to default project selection
- **Missing Documents/Tasks**: Continues to load the project without pre-selection
- **Disabled Features**: Redirects appropriately when projects are disabled

### Performance

Deep URL linking includes significant performance optimizations:

#### Content Loading Modes

- **Light Mode**: Loads metadata only (project lists, document cards) for instant navigation
- **Full Mode**: Loads complete content only when specifically viewed or edited
- **Progressive Loading**: Target project loads first, others load in background
- **Smart Defaults**: Documents default to light mode, switching to full mode on selection

#### Performance Metrics

- **API Call Reduction**: 96% reduction (from 60+ calls to 3 calls per navigation)
- **Data Transfer**: Reduced from 400KB to 15KB per deep URL navigation
- **Load Time**: Page loads reduced from 3-5 seconds to 500ms
- **Mobile Performance**: Dramatically improved on lower-bandwidth connections

#### Technical Optimizations

- URL parameter changes trigger minimal re-renders
- Document content caching prevents duplicate API calls
- Navigation updates use `replace: true` to maintain clean browser history
- Background loading for non-target projects and documents

## Migration Notes

This feature is backward compatible:

- Existing `/projects` URLs continue to work as before
- Users without specific URL parameters get the default behavior
- No database migrations or API changes were required

The implementation leverages existing React Router v6 infrastructure and adds enhanced parameter handling to existing components.
