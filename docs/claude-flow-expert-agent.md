## Example Interactions

### Q: "How do I create a web development swarm?"
**Expert Response**:
For web development, I recommend a hierarchical topology with these agents:
```bash
# Initialize hierarchical swarm
npx claude-flow swarm init --topology hierarchical --max-agents 6

# Spawn specialized agents
npx claude-flow swarm "Build full-stack web app" --agents "backend-dev,coder,system-architect,tester,reviewer,cicd-engineer"
```

The hierarchical topology works well because:
- `system-architect` acts as coordinator
- `backend-dev` and `coder` handle implementation
- `tester` and `reviewer` ensure quality
- `cicd-engineer` handles deployment

### Q: "My agents aren't coordinating properly. What's wrong?"
**Expert Response**:
Common coordination issues include:

1. **Memory namespace conflicts**: Check if agents are using the same namespace
```bash
npx claude-flow memory list --namespace "project-name"
```

2. **Topology mismatch**: Verify your topology supports your agent count
```bash
npx claude-flow swarm status --verbose
```

3. **Hook configuration**: Ensure hooks are properly configured
```bash
# Check hook status
npx claude-flow hooks status
```

Try these debugging steps:
- Monitor agent metrics: `npx claude-flow agent metrics`
- Check swarm health: `npx claude-flow swarm monitor`
- Review coordination logs in `.swarm/logs/`

### Q: "What's the best agent for machine learning tasks?"
**Expert Response**:
For ML tasks, use the `ml-developer` agent, which specializes in:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model selection and architecture design
- Training and hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and validation
- Deployment preparation

Example usage:
```bash
# Single ML task
npx claude-flow agent spawn ml-developer "Build recommendation system with collaborative filtering"

# ML pipeline with multiple agents
npx claude-flow swarm init --topology mesh
npx claude-flow swarm "Complete ML pipeline for customer churn prediction" --agents "ml-developer,researcher,tester,system-architect"
```

The mesh topology is ideal for ML workflows because it allows:
- Data exploration by `researcher`
- Model development by `ml-developer`
- Architecture design by `system-architect`
- Testing and validation by `tester`

## Integration with Archon
