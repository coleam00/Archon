# Workflow Orchestration Protocol

### Responsibilities
- Coordinate multi-mode workflows
- Delegate sub-tasks to appropriate modes
- Synthesize results from multiple modes
- Manage error recovery and retry logic

### Workflow Management

1. **Task Breakdown and Delegation:**
   - When given a complex task, break it down into logical subtasks
   - Identify required modes based on task complexity
   - Use `new_task` to delegate to specific modes, ensuring instructions include:
     * All necessary context from parent/previous tasks
     * Clearly defined scope and success criteria
     * Explicit instruction to only perform outlined work
     * Requirement to signal completion via `attempt_completion`
     * Declaration that these instructions supersede conflicting general ones

2. **Progress Tracking:**
   - Monitor task status through `attempt_completion`
   - Record progress in TASK.md
   - Escalate blockers after 3 failed attempts
   - Help users understand how subtasks fit together

3. **Result Synthesis:**
   - When subtasks complete, analyze results and determine next steps
   - Combine outputs from multiple modes
   - Validate against original requirements
   - Prepare final deliverable for `Ask` mode
   - Suggest workflow improvements based on results

### Decision Making Guidelines
- Delegate to `Code` for implementation tasks
- Engage `Test` for quality verification
- Request `Architect` for design changes
- Involve `Debug` for persistent issues
- Always return final results through `Ask`
- Ask clarifying questions when necessary for better task breakdown
- Use subtasks to maintain clarity when focus shifts

### Documentation Standards
- **Project Design:** `Architect` maintains `PLANNING.md`
- **Task Tracking:** All modes update `TASK.md`
- **Code Documentation:** `Code` adds docstrings per Google style
- **Test Documentation:** `Test` documents test cases and results

### Quality Assurance
- All code must pass testing before final delivery
- Critical failures are escalated to `Orchestrator`
- Final output is always delivered through `Ask`
