# Console (spike)

A greenfield spike of Archon's web UI built around four primitives:

- **Project · Run · Workflow · Worktree**

Mounted at `/console/*`. Not part of the shipped product. Validates the mental model before any migration. If dogfooding succeeds, extract to `packages/console` and begin replacing production surfaces. If it fails, we learn cheaply.

## Routes

- `/console` → Runs view (scope = `all`)
- `/console/settings` → Settings (assistant config, system health, GitHub identity) — global
- `/console/p/:projectId` → Runs view scoped to a project
- `/console/p/:projectId/chat` → Project-scoped agent chat
- `/console/p/:projectId/r/:runId` → Run detail

## Constraints

- **Isolated.** Forbidden imports from `packages/web/src/{components,stores,contexts,routes,hooks}` and `@tanstack/react-query`, `@/lib/api` (function exports). Enforced by ESLint. Type-only imports from `@/lib/api.generated` are allowed.
- **Skill API is the single mutation surface.** Every UI action calls one skill verb. See `skills/`.
- **Design tokens reused.** Uses the oklch semantic tokens from `packages/web/src/index.css` (`bg-surface`, `text-text-primary`, `bg-success`, `bg-warning`, `bg-error`, etc.).
- **Vocabulary.** Only *Project, Run, Workflow, Worktree* appear in user-facing copy. No *Dashboard, Deployment, Infrastructure, Secrets, Activity, Pipeline, Stage*.

## Persisted UI state (localStorage)

Client-only view preferences. All reads are try/catch-guarded and fall back to the default, so a disabled/over-quota store never breaks rendering.

| Key | Default | Set by | Purpose |
|-----|---------|--------|---------|
| `archon.console.detailView` | `log` | Run detail | Active tab (`log` / `graph` / `artifacts`) |
| `archon.console.showToolCalls` | `1` (on) | Run detail | Tool-calls toggle in the stream |
| `archon.console.showSystem` | `0` (off) | Run detail | System/detail toggle in the stream |
| `archon.console.runNodeFilter` | `all` | Run detail | Node filter (`all` or a nodeId); auto-resets when the node is absent from the open run |
| `archon.console.railWidth` | — | Project rail | Persisted sidebar width |
| `archon.console.lastWorkflow` | — | Chat / dispatch | Last-used workflow |

## Status

Active experiment under `/console`. The original milestoned plan (`M1`–`M4`)
that scaffolded this surface has been completed; ongoing work is driven by
user feedback during dogfooding rather than a milestone roadmap. Issues and
ideas land via the PR template's UX Journey section.
