<!-- AUTO-GENERATED — DO NOT EDIT. Regenerate with: bun run generate:capability-matrix -->

:::note
This page is **auto-generated** from each provider's `capabilities.ts` (the same
constants the workflow engine reads to warn when a node uses a feature its
provider ignores). Do not edit it by hand — run `bun run generate:capability-matrix`.
A capability change fails `bun run validate` until this page is regenerated.
:::

Each column is a registered provider id (the value you set as `provider:` in a
workflow or `.archon/config.yaml`). A ✅ means Archon translates the corresponding
per-node YAML field for that provider; a ❌ means the field is accepted but ignored
(the dag-executor emits a visible warning when the run reaches such a node).

## Providers

- `claude` — Claude (Anthropic)
- `codex` — Codex (OpenAI)
- `opencode` — OpenCode (community) *(community provider)*
- `pi` — Pi (community) *(community provider)*
- `copilot` — Copilot (GitHub) *(community provider)*

## Legend

- **✅ / ❌** — the per-node field is wired for this provider, or accepted-but-ignored.
- **Structured output** — `enforced` (the SDK/backend grammar-constrains decoding),
  `best-effort` (schema appended to the prompt, then validated + re-asked up to 3×),
  or ❌ (unsupported). See [AI Assistants → Structured output guarantees](/getting-started/ai-assistants/#structured-output-guarantees).
- **In-process native tools** — the provider can register Archon `NativeTool`s for a
  turn (gates auto-injection of Archon's `manage_run` tool into project-scoped chat).

For per-provider field-level notes (YAML syntax, caveats), see the
[AI Assistants guide](/getting-started/ai-assistants/).
