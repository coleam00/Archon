## 📋 What to Build

### HTML Elements

```html
<!-- [Description of HTML to add] -->
<div class="[tailwind-classes]">
  <!-- Specific HTML structure here -->
</div>
```

### JavaScript (if needed)

```javascript
// [Description of JavaScript functionality]
function [functionName]() {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Tailwind Classes to Use

**Key classes for this section**:

- `[class-category]`: `[specific-classes]`
- `[class-category]`: `[specific-classes]`

**Example combinations**:

```html
<!-- Input field -->
<input
  class="w-full px-3 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[project]-500"
/>

<!-- Button -->
<button
  class="w-full py-3 bg-[project]-600 text-white rounded-lg font-semibold hover:bg-[project]-700 transition-colors"

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### Agent-Verifiable (Puppeteer)

| #   | Criterion   | Element      | Expected | How to Verify |
| --- | ----------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------- |
| 1   | [Criterion] | `[selector]` | [Value]  | [Method]      |
| 2   | [Criterion] | `[selector]` | [Value]  | [Method]      |
| 3   | [Criterion] | `[selector]` | [Value]  | [Method]      |

### User-Evaluable (Qualitative)

- [ ] Flow feels natural and intuitive
- [ ] Visual hierarchy guides the eye correctly
- [ ] Section feels consistent with the rest of the prototype
- [ ] [Additional qualitative criterion]

## 🧪 How to Test

### Puppeteer Self-Verification (Agent)

Before presenting to user:

1. Open `[Page-Number]-[Page-Name].html` in Puppeteer
2. Set viewport to target width (375px for mobile)
3. For each agent-verifiable criterion in the table above:
   - Locate element
   - Read actual value
   - Compare to expected
   - Narrate with ✓/✗
4. Fix any mismatches and re-verify until all pass
5. Check console for errors

See [Inline Testing Guide](../guides/INLINE-TESTING-GUIDE.md) for full methodology.

### User Qualitative Review

After Puppeteer verification passes, present to user:

- Summarize Puppeteer results (X/Y criteria pass)
- Ask user to evaluate qualitative criteria above
- Collect feedback on feel, flow, clarity, consistency
