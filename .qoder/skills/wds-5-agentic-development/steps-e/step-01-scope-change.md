# Step 1: Scope Change

## STEP GOAL:

Define exactly what is new, what is modified, and what must remain untouched.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are an Implementation Partner guiding structured development activities
- ✅ If you already have been given a name, communication_style and persona, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring software development methodology expertise, user brings domain knowledge and codebase familiarity
- ✅ Maintain clear and structured tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on defining scope: new functionality, existing unchanged functionality, boundary map, and integration points
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to begin analyzing impact or planning implementation — those are later steps
- 💬 Approach: Help user categorize all affected areas into new/modified/untouched
- 📋 Every integration point must be identified and documented

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Produce a clear boundary map categorizing all areas as new, modified, or untouched
- 💾 Update dialog file with scope definition, boundary map, and integration points
- 📖 Reference the feature spec or change request
- 🚫 Do not analyze dependencies or plan implementation yet

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Feature specification or change request
- Focus: Scoping what changes and what stays the same
- Limits: No impact analysis, no implementation planning
- Dependencies: A feature spec or change request must exist

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Load Feature Spec

- Read the feature specification or change request
- Understand the desired outcome from the user's perspective
- Clarify any ambiguities before proceeding

### 2. List All New Functionality

- Enumerate every new capability being added
- For each item: what it does, where it lives, how the user interacts with it
- Note any new UI components, API endpoints, data models, or routes

### 3. List All Existing Functionality That Must Stay Unchanged

- Identify every existing feature that is in scope or adjacent
- Explicitly state: "This must continue to work exactly as it does now"
- Include both direct features and indirect dependencies (e.g., shared components)

### 4. Create Boundary Map

Categorize all affected areas:

| Category      | Description                     | Examples                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **New**       | Does not exist yet, being added | New page, new API endpoint, new component                    |
| **Modified**  | Exists and will be changed      | Updated component to accept new props, extended API response |
| **Untouched** | Exists and must not change      | Existing pages, unrelated features, shared utilities         |

### 5. Identify Integration Points

- Where does new code connect to existing code?
- What interfaces, APIs, or data structures are shared?
- Are there shared components that need to support both old and new behavior?
- Document each integration point and its risk level

### 6. Verify Checklist

- [ ] Feature spec loaded and understood
- [ ] New functionality listed
- [ ] Existing functionality that must stay unchanged listed
- [ ] Boundary map created (new / modified / untouched)
- [ ] Integration points identified
- [ ] Dialog file updated with scope definition

### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [C] Continue to Step 2: Analyze Impact"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Update design log, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options]

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then redisplay menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN the scope is fully defined with boundary map and integration points will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Feature spec loaded and understood
- New functionality listed
- Existing functionality that must stay unchanged listed
- Boundary map created (new / modified / untouched)
- Integration points identified
- Dialog file updated with scope definition

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Beginning impact analysis before scope is defined
- Not identifying what must remain untouched
- Skipping integration point identification
- Leaving ambiguities in the feature spec unresolved

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
