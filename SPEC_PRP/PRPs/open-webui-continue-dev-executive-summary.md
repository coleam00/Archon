**Architecture Flow:**
```
Continue.dev (VS Code) 
    ‚Üì (OpenAI API calls)
Open WebUI (API Gateway + Tools)
    ‚Üì (Custom Python Tool)
Archon RAG Server (Knowledge Base)
```

**Why This Method:**

- ‚úÖ Native function calling support
- ‚úÖ Streaming responses with progress updates
- ‚úÖ IDE-optimized result formatting
- ‚úÖ Built-in caching for performance
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling

## Implementation Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Open WebUI running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Archon RAG system on `http://localhost:8181`
- Continue.dev extension in VS Code
- Open WebUI administrative access

### Setup Time
- **Quick Setup (Direct API)**: 15 minutes
- **Recommended Setup (Custom Tool)**: 1-2 hours
- **Advanced Setup**: 4+ hours

### Technical Components Required

1. **Open WebUI API Key Generation**
2. **Custom Archon RAG Tool Installation** (complete Python code provided)
3. **Continue.dev Configuration** (complete YAML configs provided)
4. **Model and Tool Activation**
5. **Testing and Validation**

## Key Technical Insights

### Continue.dev Capabilities
- Full OpenAI-compatible API support
- Sophisticated configuration system via `config.yaml`
- Multiple model roles (chat, edit, autocomplete)
- Native function calling for modern LLMs
- Comprehensive context providers

### Open WebUI Integration Points
- OpenAI API compatible endpoints at `/api/chat/completions`
- Native Python function calling through Tools system
- Built-in streaming support via `__event_emitter__`
- Flexible configuration through Valves system
- Tool activation per model

### Archon RAG Access Methods
- Direct API calls to `/api/rag/query`
- Code-specific search via `/api/rag/code-examples`
- Source listing through `/api/rag/sources`
- Full integration through custom Open WebUI tool

## Current Limitations and Solutions

### Known Issues (2025)
1. **Continue.dev v0.9.224+ Autocomplete Issues**
   - **Solution**: Use Continue.dev v0.8.55 or configure separate autocomplete model

2. **Open WebUI API Endpoint Changes**
   - **Solution**: Use `/api/chat/completions` (not `/api/v1/chat/completions`)

3. **Limited RAG Access via OpenAI API**
   - **Solution**: Use custom tool integration for full functionality

### Recommended Versions
- **Continue.dev**: v0.8.55 (best compatibility)
- **Open WebUI**: v0.3.35 or later
- **VS Code**: Latest stable

## Integration Benefits
